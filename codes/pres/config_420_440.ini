; ***********************************************
;******************************************************************************
; Configuration settings relevant for Attended Mode
;
;   Always start the Web Server (ie always go into Attended Mode), regardless
;   of an active Ethernet connection. Default 0.
AlwaysAttended=0
;
;   Check for an Ethernet connection on power-up (1=yes; 0=no)
;   Default=1
CheckEthernet=1
;
;   When used in attended mode, and doing a Trial Sub-Burst, the maximum
;   depth that is displayed on the FFT (A-scope) display. This can be
;   overwritten from the browser
maxDepthToGraph=1500

; Configuration settings relevant for both Attended and Unattended modes
;

;   Number of samples per burst (>= 40,001; default=40,001)
N_ADC_SAMPLES=40001
;
;
;
;   Additions applicable to Version 14 of Firmware. Default Tx and Rx antenna
; settings (previously they defaulted to Tx 1 and Rx 1). And Alternate, which indicates
; that every other burst will be monostatic, using MonoRx and MonoTx.
MonoTx=1
MonoRx=1
Alternate=0
ANTENNA_SELECT=1
;
;
;   WatchDog task behaviour. Time in seconds of operation after which;
;   radar will be reset.  Assumption is that a fault has occurred if radar
;   is active for longer than this time.  Watchdog does not operate in
;   attended mode.  If Watchdog time is set to 0, then the default of 3600
;   seconds is used.  If set to -1, then Watchdog task is disabled.
WATCHDOG_TASK_SECS=3600
;
;
;   Number of sub-bursts in a burst (>=0)
;   Default=10
NSubBursts=5
;
;  Are all the chirps from this burst to be stored individually (0),
;  averaged (1) or stacked (2) (Should not be used if nAttenuators>1 or
; if using in MIMO mode)
Average=1
;
;   Burst repetition period (integer seconds) (>0).  Interpretation depends
;   on IntervalMode.  If IntervalMode = 0 (default), RepSecs is time from
;   start of one burst to the start of the next.  If IntervalMode = 1,
;   RepSecs is interval between end of one burst and start of next.
; 21600 = 6 hours; Alternating  between qMono and MIMO every other burst. 
RepSecs=1
IntervalMode=0
;
;   Maximum length of data file before another one started (>=1,000,000)
;   Default=10,000,000
MAX_DATA_FILE_LENGTH=10000000
;
; Whether a logging file is to be maintained (default = no (0)).
LOGON=1
;
;   Number of combinations of attenuator settings to be used
nAttenuators=1
;
;   Attenuator setting sequences (dB) (>0, <=31.5)
;   Defaults=30dB.
Attenuator1=1,0,0,0
;   Attenuator2=12,0,0,0
;
;   In unattended mode, does the radar sleep between bursts (default, 0),
;   or does it wait (1).  In the sleep case the system is powered down
;   between bursts and draws a low current (<200uA). Otherwise system
;   remains powered and draws ~1 Amp.
SleepMode=0
;
;   Time out for GPS receiver for each burst (0-255 seconds)?
;   Default is 0 - do not attempt to obtain fix before each burst. 
GPSon=0
;
;   Undertake daily housekeeping (GPS clock check, Iridium exchange and
;   memory card check? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Housekeeping=1
;
;   If GPS fix obtained during daily housekeeping, synchronise radar clock
;   to GPS time (only if Housekeeping=1)? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
GPSsync=0
;
;   If Housekeeping=1, is Iridium messaging enabled? (1 = yes, 0 = no)
;   Default = 0
Iridium=1
;
;
TxAnt=1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
RxAnt=1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
;
;   Very much for the advanced user. The DDS programming strings.
;   These strings are set by defaults in the instrument and, like the
;   rest of the parameters in the config file, do not need to be set here.
;   They are included for completeness.  See main text.
